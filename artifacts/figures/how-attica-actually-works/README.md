# How does Attica actually work, once you have been away from it?

Screenshots taken from [the interactive scenes](../../scenes/how-attica-actually-works/), kept so
the pictures are readable without running anything.

## What is in here

One standalone figure, and one set of five walkthrough frames.

**What it shows**

**How we got this image**

A screenshot of the `attica-runtime-topology` scene, tab 1 ("Request and socket topology"), first
frame of its guided walk, captured 2026-08-15.

**What it lets you say**

In development the browser only ever talks to Vite on `:5173`. Vite forwards `/api`, `/vendors`,
`/cart` and `/checkout` to Django, and forwards `/ws` with `ws: true`, so the socket upgrade
survives the hop.

**What it cannot say**

Nothing about production, and nothing about the paths this frame greys out. It is one of six frames
in one of three tabs.

**Where it came from and what judged it**

`frontend/vite.config.js` and `backend/main/main/routing.py`, by way of the scene.
It corroborates a fact in [the environment overview](../../../environment/overview.md): the `/ws`
[proxy](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/System%20Design/Scaling/Reverse%20Proxy.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=397 "System design big archive, Forward proxy versus reverse proxy, The two side by side: a forward proxy acts for users (protecting them, blocking sites, caching..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/grokking-the-system-design-interview.pdf#page=18 "Grokking the system design interview, section 15, Proxy server, Open, anonymous and transparent proxies, then the reverse proxy that fetches from servers and..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=312 "System design big archive, Load balancers vs API gateways vs reverse proxy, How a reverse proxy overlaps with a load balancer and an API gateway, and how the..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2G49HZxnRE&t=300s "Hussein Nasser, The Anatomy of a Proxy Server, Connection Establishment with an HTTP Proxy, 5:00 to 15:22, Traces one connection through an HTTP proxy, after..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NB0NDtOwIQ&t=132s "ByteByteGo, Proxy vs Reverse Proxy (Real-world Examples), Reverse Proxy, 2:12 to 4:15, The reverse proxy after the forward and transparent proxy chapters.

**Held since 2026-08-22.** No plan names it; kept because it is the cheapest available proof of
that correction.

## The sets

### organizer-journey-walkthrough

**The question.** What does one organizer actually do, and what does the system actually do back?

**How it is sorted.** Five frames in walk order, `j0` through `j4`, following the organizer from
login to booking an artist.

**How many cells.** Five.

**One example.**

![](organizer-journey-walkthrough/j0.png)

**How we got these images**

Screenshots of the `attica-organizer-journey` scene, captured 2026-08-15 while walking its guided
route.

**What they cannot say**

They are frames of a scene, not of the live application. What they show is the scene's rendering of
a trace, which was itself taken from the repository rather than from a running server.

**Where they came from and what judged them**

[The organizer journey scene](../../scenes/how-attica-actually-works/attica-organizer-journey/).
**Held since 2026-08-22.** No plan names this set.
