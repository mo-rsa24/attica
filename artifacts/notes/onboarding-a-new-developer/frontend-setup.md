# Frontend Setup Guide

Get the Attica React/Vite frontend running locally and connected to the backend.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Check | Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | `node --version` | 16 |
| npm | `npm --version` | 8 |
| Backend running | `curl http://localhost:8000/api/` | must return JSON |

The backend must be on `:8000` before the login step. npm install and Vite startup
can happen while the backend is still starting.

See [the backend setup guide](backend-setup.md) if the backend is not yet running. On a
machine with no Node/Python/Redis installed at all, start at [the machine setup
guide](00-machine-setup.md) instead.

---

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

This reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and downloads all packages into
`node_modules/`. Key packages: React 19, Vite 7, Material-UI 7, TailwindCSS 3,
Axios, react-router-dom 7, jwt-decode.

**Expected output:** Lines of package names, ending without any red `npm ERR!` lines.
`node_modules/` folder appears (~400 MB, ~200+ packages).

**Confirm no conflicts before moving on:**

```bash
npm ls
```

**Expected result:** a dependency tree with no `UNMET DEPENDENCY` or `invalid`
markers. Some `npm WARN deprecated` lines from transitive dependencies are normal
and not a problem; `npm ERR!` or `invalid` entries are.

**If install fails or `npm ls` shows problems:** don't delete `package-lock.json`.
The lockfile is what makes this install reproducible across machines — deleting it
lets npm re-resolve every caret range (`^19.1.0` etc.) against whatever is newest
*today*, which can introduce a conflict that wasn't there when the lockfile was
committed. Instead:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm ci
```

`npm ci` installs exactly what `package-lock.json` specifies and fails loudly if
the lockfile and `package.json` have drifted, instead of silently re-resolving.
If `npm ci` itself fails, check the Node version (`node --version`, need ≥ 16) —
a too-old Node is the most common cause.

---

## 2. Understand the Vite Proxy (Read Before Starting)

The frontend (`localhost:5173`) and backend (`localhost:8000`) are on different ports.
Browsers treat different ports as different origins and block [cross-origin requests](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/Networking/CORS.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka8vG5miErk&t=240s "Hussein Nasser, Cross Origin Resource Sharing (Explained by Example), No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present, 4:00 to 8:10, The first CORS error ..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka8vG5miErk&t=610s "Hussein Nasser, Cross Origin Resource Sharing (Explained by Example), OPTIONS 405 Method not Allowed (Preflight failed), 10:10 to 17:00, A preflight request ..."), [◆](../../../../../goal-setting/learning/projects/attica/event-creation/plans/02-rebuild-from-scratch/plans/13-vite-proxy-and-cors.md "The Vite proxy and CORS, projects/attica/event-creation/plans/02-rebuild-from-scratch, plan 13. The wizard wired to the backend three ways in turn: broken cr...")</sub> (CORS).

Vite's dev server solves this with a [proxy](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/System%20Design/Scaling/Reverse%20Proxy.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=397 "System design big archive, Forward proxy versus reverse proxy, The two side by side: a forward proxy acts for users (protecting them, blocking sites, caching..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/grokking-the-system-design-interview.pdf#page=18 "Grokking the system design interview, section 15, Proxy server, Open, anonymous and transparent proxies, then the reverse proxy that fetches from servers and..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=312 "System design big archive, Load balancers vs API gateways vs reverse proxy, How a reverse proxy overlaps with a load balancer and an API gateway, and how the..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2G49HZxnRE&t=300s "Hussein Nasser, The Anatomy of a Proxy Server, Connection Establishment with an HTTP Proxy, 5:00 to 15:22, Traces one connection through an HTTP proxy, after..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NB0NDtOwIQ&t=132s "ByteByteGo, Proxy vs Reverse Proxy (Real-world Examples), Reverse Proxy, 2:12 to 4:15, The reverse proxy after the forward and transparent proxy chapters.

is silently forwarded to `http://localhost:8000`. The browser only ever talks to `:5173`.

Open `frontend/vite.config.js` to confirm it contains:

```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api':      'http://localhost:8000',
    '/vendors':  'http://localhost:8000',
    '/cart':     'http://localhost:8000',
    '/checkout': 'http://localhost:8000',
    '/ws': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8000',
      ws: true,                   // ← required for WebSocket proxy
    },
  },
},
```

**No changes needed — this is already configured.** You are reading it to understand
where to look when something breaks. The `/ws` entry is critical: it proxies [WebSocket](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/Networking/WebSocket.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-interview.pdf#page=182 "System design interview, chapter 12, Design a chat system, WebSocket, The connection the client opens as HTTP and upgrades through a handshake, bi-directiona..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-interview.pdf#page=190 "System design interview, chapter 12, Design a chat system, Service discovery and 1 on 1 chat flow, Works one message end to end: user A connects to chat serv..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=425 "System design big archive, Can a web server provide real-time updates?, WebSocket against server-sent events: both let the server send the latest data once c..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Nt-ZrNP22A&t=870s "Hussein Nasser, WebSockets Crash Course, WebSockets Example Code, 14:30 to 36:40, A WebSocket server and client written on screen.

## 3. Start the Vite Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
  VITE v7.0.0  ready in 312 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.x.x:5173/
```

Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is now active: edit any source file and the browser
updates instantly without a full reload.

**If port 5173 is taken:** Add `port: 5174` under `server:` in `vite.config.js` and restart.

---

## 4. Open in Browser

```
http://localhost:5173
```

You should see the login page. Check the browser console (F12 → Console) — there should
be no [CORS](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/Networking/CORS.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka8vG5miErk&t=240s "Hussein Nasser, Cross Origin Resource Sharing (Explained by Example), No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present, 4:00 to 8:10, The first CORS error ..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka8vG5miErk&t=610s "Hussein Nasser, Cross Origin Resource Sharing (Explained by Example), OPTIONS 405 Method not Allowed (Preflight failed), 10:10 to 17:00, A preflight request ..."), [◆](../../../../../goal-setting/learning/projects/attica/event-creation/plans/02-rebuild-from-scratch/plans/13-vite-proxy-and-cors.md "The Vite proxy and CORS, projects/attica/event-creation/plans/02-rebuild-from-scratch, plan 13.

**If you see CORS errors:**

- Check `vite.config.js` has the proxy entries from step 2.

**If you see connection refused:**
- Backend is not running. Start it: `cd backend/main && daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 main.asgi:application`

---

## 5. Login

Enter the seeded credentials:

```
Username: e2e-organizer
Password: E2eOrganizerPass!23
```

**What the login flow does:**

1. Login form submits: `POST /api/accounts/token/` (proxied → backend `:8000`)
2. Django validates credentials, returns:
   ```json
   { "access": "eyJhbGci...", "refresh": "eyJhbGci..." }
   ```
3. `AuthProvider.jsx` stores both tokens in `localStorage` under key `tokens`:
   ```json
   { "access": "eyJhbGci...", "refresh": "eyJhbGci..." }
   ```
4. App redirects to dashboard or event list.

**If login returns 401:**
The `e2e-organizer` user does not exist. Run on the backend:
```bash
cd backend/main
python manage.py seed_e2e
```

---

## 6. Verify Everything Works

Open DevTools (F12) and run through these checks:

### Tokens stored
**Application → Local Storage → `http://localhost:5173`**

Look for key `tokens`. It should be a JSON object:
```json
{ "access": "eyJ...", "refresh": "eyJ..." }
```
If it is absent, the login POST failed — check the Network tab for the request.

### API calls authenticated
**Network tab → click any request to `/api/...`**

Headers should include:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
Status should be `200 OK`.

### Token auto-refresh
The access token expires after **30 minutes**. When it does, the Axios interceptor
automatically calls `POST /api/accounts/token/refresh/` with the refresh token,
stores the new access token, and retries the original request. You will see this as a
brief extra network request — the user sees no interruption.

If the refresh token also expires (after 7 days), the user is logged out and redirected
to `/login`.

### WebSocket connected (optional)
Open a page that uses real-time chat. In DevTools:
**Network → WS tab**

You should see a connection to:
```
ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat/rooms/<room_id>/?token=<access_token>
```

The token is passed as a query parameter because browsers cannot set custom headers on
