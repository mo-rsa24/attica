---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, confirm:

- **Python 3.12** — `python3.12 --version` should print `3.12.x`
- **[Redis](../../../../../Obsidian/Software/Redis.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-interview.pdf#page=62 "System design interview, chapter 4, Design a rate limiter, High-level architecture, Works Redis as the counter store with its two commands: INCR adds one to ..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=318 "System design big archive, The life of a Redis query, Why an in-memory store can lose data on a restart, and Redis's two ways to persist it: the append-only ..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=97 "System design big archive, Redis vs Memcached, What Redis's data structures are good for: a hash to count clicks, a sorted set to rank and dedupe users, a bi..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkwKyUZWkp4&t=0s "Hussein Nasser, Spin up Redis on Docker and learn basic commands, 0:00 to 9:47, Redis started in a Docker container and driven with its basic commands.

- **Repo cloned** — you're in the `attica/` directory

If any of these aren't in place yet (including on a fresh Windows machine with
nothing installed), start at [the machine setup guide](00-machine-setup.md) instead,
which walks through installing WSL2, Python 3.12, Node, and Redis from scratch.

If Redis is installed but not running: `redis-server` (macOS/Linux), start the
Redis Windows service, or on WSL2 see [installing and starting Redis](00-machine-setup.md#6-install-and-start-redis).

---

## 1. Create Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps Attica's packages isolated from your system Python. This prevents version conflicts and makes the environment reproducible.

```bash
cd backend
python3.12 -m venv venv
```

**Expected result:** a `backend/venv/` directory is created containing a private Python interpreter and package store.

---

## 2. Activate Virtual Environment

Activation points your shell at the venv's Python and pip, not the system ones.

**macOS / Linux (bash or zsh):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Expected result:** your prompt now shows `(venv)` as a prefix. Every `python` and `pip` command now runs inside the venv.

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

You should still be in the `backend/` directory (the `venv/` folder should be
next to you). Confirm which requirements file you're about to install from:

```bash
cat main/requirements.txt | wc -l
```

**Expected result:** `62`. If this file doesn't exist, or a bare `requirements.txt`
in your current directory has a different line count, stop and check
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below — installing the wrong file pulls in
packages Attica doesn't use and use of the correct pinned versions is what makes
this step reproducible.

```bash
pip install -r main/requirements.txt
```

This reads `backend/main/requirements.txt` and installs all required packages into the venv.

**Expected result:** ~50 packages installed, ending with output like:
```
Successfully installed django-5.1.x djangorestframework-3.x.x channels-4.x.x ...
```

**Confirm no conflicts before moving on:**

```bash
pip check
```

**Expected result:** `No broken requirements found.` If this prints anything else,
stop here: a version conflict now will surface later as a confusing runtime error
during migrate or server startup, not a clear one here. Every package in
`requirements.txt` is pinned with `==`, so `pip check` failing on a clean venv
almost always means the venv wasn't actually clean (see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) or `python3.12` resolved to a Python version
pip had to compromise on.

---

## 4. Run Database Migrations

Migrations are versioned Python files that describe schema changes (create table, add column, etc.). Running `migrate` applies them in order to produce the full [database schema](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/Database%20Systems/Database%20Schema.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/database-systems/database-systems-textbook.pdf#page=277 "Database systems textbook, section 7-2, Data definition commands, A schema as a logical group of tables and indexes created with 'CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/database-systems/database-systems-textbook.pdf#page=309 "Database systems textbook, section 7-5, Additional data definition commands, Changing a schema after it exists: 'ALTER TABLE' with ADD, MODIFY and DROP for c..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-interview.pdf#page=256 "System design interview, chapter 15, Metadata database, Works a real schema: Google Drive's metadata tables (user, device, namespace, file, file version and ..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUcPS6dsWx4&t=1034s "Hello Interview, Data Modeling in System Design Interviews, Entities, Keys, & Relationships, 17:14 to 21:31, Laying out the entities, their keys and the rela..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7diJPGxCGo&t=671s "BugBytes, Django ORM Deep Dive - Models, Migrations and Admin UI Integration, Migrations in Django to apply database changes, 11:11 to 15:31, Django migratio..."), [◆](../../../../../goal-setting/learning/ai-engineering/one-business-end-to-end/plans/06-the-ddl-written-and-run.md "The DDL written and run, with CHECK constraints encoding the three kinds of till row, ai-engineering/one-business-end-to-end, plan 06. Works it on the shop: ...")</sub>.

```bash
cd main
python manage.py migrate
```

**Expected result:** output listing migrations for each app, ending with:
```
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying users.0001_initial... OK
  ...
  Applying tickets.0001_initial... OK
```

Creates `backend/main/db.sqlite3` — the SQLite database file. This file is gitignored; every developer generates their own from migrations.

---

## 5. Seed Test Data (Optional)

The database starts completely empty. The seed command populates it with deterministic test fixtures needed for end-to-end tests.

```bash
python manage.py seed_e2e
```

**Expected result:**
```
Created organizer: e2e-organizer
Created vendors: ...
Seed complete.
```

**Credentials created:**
- Username: `e2e-organizer`
- Password: `E2eOrganizerPass!23`

**When to run:** before running the Playwright test suite (`npm run test:e2e` in `frontend/`). The suite expects this user to exist.

**When to skip:** when developing a new feature with its own data, or when you want a clean empty database to start from.

The seed command is [idempotent](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/System%20Design/Reliability/Idempotency.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-interview.pdf#page=160 "System design interview, chapter 10, Design a notification system, Reliability, Works the duplicate-notification case: delivery cannot be exactly once, so ea..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=380 "System design big archive, How to Design Good APIs, Which HTTP methods are idempotent (GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE) and which are not (POST, PATCH), then idempote..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=143 "System design big archive, A Cheatsheet on REST API Design Best Practices, Idempotent endpoints for safe retries, especially for POST, and idempotency keys t..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6DtqSb1BDM&t=673s "Arpit Bhayani, Build a robust Payments service using Idempotency Keys, Flow, 11:13 to 16:36, The flow of a payment request carrying an idempotency key, after..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OuaONkZw1I&t=68s "Hussein Nasser, Why Idempotency is very critical in Backend Applications, What is Idempotency, 1:08 to 7:12, What idempotency means for a backend request.

## 6. Start the Server

### Option A — Daphne (recommended)

Daphne is an ASGI server that handles both [HTTP](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/Networking/HTTP.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-interview.pdf#page=7 "System design interview, chapter 1, Scale from zero to millions of users, Works one request with real values: DNS returns 15.125.23.214, then an HTTP request..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=427 "System design big archive, Evolution of HTTP, Each version in one line: HTTP/0.9's single GET, HTTP/1.0's headers and status codes with a new connection per ..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=79 "System design big archive, HTTP/1 -> HTTP/2 -> HTTP/3, The dates (1996, 1997, 2015, 2019) and what each version added: pipelining and headers, then stream pr..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OrmKCB0UrQ&t=720s "Hussein Nasser, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Crash Course, Demo Request/Response, Build Web Server, 12:00 to 20:20, A request and its response shown on a web..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzwjnoPI--M&t=190s "Arpit Bhayani, What exactly is the HTTP protocol and how to write a new one from scratch?, Raw TCP HTTP request demo, 3:10 to 6:12, An HTTP request typed by ..."), [◆](../../../../../goal-setting/learning/system-design/foundations/textbook/04-the-shell-curl-and-status-codes.md "The shell, curl and status codes, system-design/foundations, chapter 04.

```bash
daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 main.asgi:application
```

**Expected result:**
```
2024-... - INFO - HTTP/1.1 protocol
Listening on endpoint tcp:interface=0.0.0.0:port=8000
```

### Option B — Django's built-in server

HTTP only. Use this if you're working on a feature that doesn't involve WebSocket and want faster restart times.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Do **not** use this when testing the chat/messaging features — WebSocket handshakes are silently rejected.

---

## 7. Verify the Setup

### REST API

Open in browser: `http://localhost:8000/api/events/`

Should return JSON — either an empty array `[]` or a list of events if seeded.

### WebSocket

You need a valid [JWT](../../../../../Obsidian/Information%20Technology/Security/JSON%20Web%20Token.md#where-to-learn-this)<sub>[1](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=236 "System design big archive, Tokens vs API Keys, Works the token flow in eight steps: a login, an identity service issuing the JWT, the frontend sending it in ..."), [2](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=51 "System design big archive, JWT 101: Key to Stateless Authentication, The header, payload and signature, then signing with one shared secret against signing w..."), [3](../../../../../Obsidian/Mathematics/references/textbooks/system-design/system-design-big-archive.pdf#page=26 "System design big archive, Cookies Vs Sessions Vs JWT Vs PASETO, Where the JWT sits among the ways to stay logged in: stateless and scalable, at the cost of ..."), [▶1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0k-3Ze4NLo&t=1696s "Hussein Nasser, JWT: JSON Web Token Crash Course (NodeJS & Postgres), Example coding, 28:16 to 42:00, JWT authentication coded in NodeJS against Postgres, af..."), [▶2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CPd9ynFLg&t=68s "ByteByteGo, Why is JWT popular?, Token structure and claims, 1:08 to 2:10, The token's parts and its claims, before the chapters on signing and on JWT's vuln..."), [◆](../../../../../goal-setting/learning/ai-engineering/llm-applications/retrieval-augmented-generation/document-qa-with-permissions/plans/09-a-token-decoded-by-hand.md "Read a token by hand, ai-engineering/llm-applications/retrieval-augmented-generation/document-qa-with-permissions, plan 09.

## Troubleshooting

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'`**

Venv is not active. Run `source venv/bin/activate` (or Windows equivalent) and try again. The `(venv)` prefix must be visible in your prompt.

**`django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table`**

Migrations have not run. Run `python manage.py migrate` from `backend/main/`.

**`ConnectionRefusedError` or `ECONNREFUSED` on WebSocket**

**`Address already in use` / port 8000 busy**

Another process is using port 8000. Use a different port:
```bash

**`ImproperlyConfigured: settings.DATABASES is improperly configured`**

You're running `manage.py` from the wrong directory. Confirm you're in `backend/main/` (where `manage.py` lives), not `backend/`.

**`pip install` fails on an unfamiliar package (e.g. `cloud-init`, `dbus-python`, `distro-info`, or anything else that sounds like an Ubuntu system package, not a Django/Python library)**

You installed from the wrong requirements file. `backend/main/requirements.txt` (62
lines) is the only one this project uses; if a stray `backend/requirements.txt`
exists in your clone, delete it or ignore it. Confirm you're in `backend/` (one
level above `main/`) when you run `pip install -r main/requirements.txt`, and that
`cat main/requirements.txt | wc -l` prints `62` before installing.

**Migrations conflict (`Your models in app(s) have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration`)**

Someone added a model change without creating a migration. Run:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Seed fails with `IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed`**

The database already has the seeded user. Either skip seeding (already done) or reset:
```bash
python manage.py flush --no-input
python manage.py seed_e2e
```
